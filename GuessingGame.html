    <h1>Colin's Guessing Game</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Colin. I am new to coding and am excited to learn as much as I can.
    I first learned about coding when I was in 6th grade. My close friend Nickolas Tarrance taught me 
    about basics of hacking, Jailbreaking devices, JTAGS, DDoS, hex code RGB mods, and other mods on a 
    couple vdieo games. Ever since then I have been in love with technology. My friend later taught me 
    the different languages of code such as Python, Java, and Javascript. Being so busy with sports and 
    school pretty much all my life, I never got around to actaully getting my hands dirty with coding.
     I look forward to becoming proficient with coding to acquire a supporting job for my future family,
      and also finally be able to code with my frined Nick as well as my brother Keaton who is also 
      enrolled in the Code Crew program.</p>

      <h3>Top Ten Things I Love</h3>
      <ol><li>Theology</li> <li>Music</li> <li>Art</li> <li>Wrestling</li> <li>Combat Sports</li>
      <li>Working Out</li> <li>Skating</li> <li>Reading</li> <li>Biblical Research</li> <li>Traveling</li></ol>

      <p>Here is one of my favortie pieces of art. It's a theologial piece of the Two Witnesses
        that are to come in the future. This piece of art is apart of the Gerona Beatus.
        The Gerona Beatus is a 10th-century illuminated manuscript 
        currently housed in the museum of Girona Cathedral, Catalonia, Spain.
        The manuscript contains two separate documents: the Commentary on the Apocalypse by 
        Beatus of Li√©bana, a late eighth-century manuscript popular in medieval Spain 
        and Jerome's commentary on the Book of Daniel. It includes 284 extant folios, each 
        measuring 400 mm by 260 mm, copiously illustrated with 184 surviving miniatures, and has been 
        described as one of the most richly decorated of the Beatus Commentaries, and one of the best 
        documented. My love for Theology runs deep. After finishing coding school, I plan to go to 
        seminary school.</p>
