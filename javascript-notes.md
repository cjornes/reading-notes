# Intro to JavaScript
<p>JavaScript "JS" for short is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.</p>

##### How to add you JavaScript to your html file
<p> <script src="scripts/main.js"></script> This is doing the same job as the <link> element for CSS. It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML.</p>


## Java Script Statements
  ### console.log("Hello World");
    <ul> <li>console.log is the function of the statement</li> <br>
    <li>("Hello World") completes the statement</li> <br> 
    <li>It is reccomended that you use semi-colons to close out statements even though it is not needed for the JavaScript language. It helps the text easier to read for the code.</li> <br> </ul>
<strong> <p>JavaScript reads line to line, left to right, top to bottom. This means it is an interperative language.<p> </strong>

## Variables of JavaScript
  ### Definition of a Variable
    <ul> <li>A variable is a container that stores data, and these containers are named by the coder.</li> </ul>
  ### Steps to Creating a Variable
    <ul> <li>You must create a variable declaration.</li> </ul>
  <p>Ex. var x; //variable decalration<br>
     x = 20; // variable assignment<br> </p> <ul> <li>Must use quotes for plain text.</li> <br> <li>Variables must start with s letter and cannot have a space.</li> <br> <li>It can however contain a small selection of special characters.</li> <br> <li>Variable names should be 
     logical, or in other words make sense.</li> <br> </ul>

### Conditional Statements
  <ul> <li>A conditional statement is a yes or no question.</li> <li>The conditional statement must be put inside of the parentheses.</li> <ul>
  <p>Ex. if(conditional ==10){

 } </p>

 ## JavaScript Expressions and Operators
  ### Operators
<ol> <li>Assignment Operators</li> <br>
     <li>Comparison Operators</li> <br>
     <li>Arithmetic Operators</li> <br>
     <li>Bitwise Operators</li> <br>
     <li>Logical operators</li> <br>
     <li>String Operators</li> <br>
     <li>Conditional <em>ternary</em> Operators</li> <br>
     <li>Comma Operators</li> <br>
     <li>Unary Operators</li> <br>
     <li>Relational Operators</li> <br> </ol>
     <p>JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator.<br> Ex. 3+4 or x*y <br> A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator.<br> Ex. x++ or ++x<br> </p>
     
  #### Examples of an Operand and a Operator
  <ul> <li>Operand Ex. 1 2 3 4...<li> <br> <li>Operator Ex. ++,+, -, /, =</li> </ul>

## JavaScript Loops
  ### Statements
<ol> <li>For</li> <br>
     <li>Do... While</li> <br>
     <li>While</li> <br>
     <li>Labled</li> <br>
     <li>Break</li> <br>
     <li>Continue</li> <br>
     <li>For.. In</li> <br>
     <li>For... Of</li> <br> </ol>
