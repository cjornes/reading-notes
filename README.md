# <strong>Introduction of Colin</strong>

<p>Hello, my name is Colin. I am new to coding and am excited to learn as much as I can.I first learned about coding when I was in 6th grade. My close friend Nickolas Terrance taught me about basics of hacking, Jailbreaking devices, JTAGS, DDoS, hex code RGB mods, and other mods on a couple vdieo games. Ever since then I have been in love with technology. My friend later taught me the different languages of code such as Python, Java, and Javascript. Being so busy with sports and school pretty much all my life, I never got around to actaully getting my hands dirty with coding. I look forward to becoming proficient with coding to acquire a supporting job for my future family, and also finally be able to cdoe with my frined Nick as well as my brother Keaton who is also enrolled in the Code Crew program.</p>
