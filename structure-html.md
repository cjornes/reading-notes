## An introduction to wireframing
<ul> <li> What is a wireframe, and why do UX designers use them? </li> </ul>
 <strong> Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.
<ul> <li> Examples of wireframes </li> </ul>
<ol> <li> Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product. </li>
 <li> With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way. </li>
 <li> Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions. <li> </ol>
