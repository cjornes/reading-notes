        <h1>The Origins of DOGE</h1>
      <p>It all started with just a "dank" meme, and a collective dream. DOGE coin was the idea of two software
        engineers Billy Markus (of IBM) and Jackson Palmer (of Adobe). The newly create crypto currency started out as a joke,
        but drastically took the internet by storm after acknowledgement from the tech giant himself, Elon Musk.
        DOGE coin was created December 6th 2013, hitting a market cap of US$85,314,347,523 on May 5, 2021.
        The goal of Billy and Jackson for creating DOGE coin besides it being a joke, was to create 
        a peer-to-peer digital currency that could reach a broader demographic than the raining king of
        crypto, Bitcoin. Upon their initial launch, <strong> <a href="https://dogecoin.com/">dogecoin.com</a> </strong>
        received over a million visits alone. Jackson Palmer is most credited for making their dream a 
        reality by purchasing the dogecoin.com domain, and adding a splash screen, which featured the 
        infamous DOGE coin logo
        and scattered <strong>Comic Sans</strong> text.</p>

      <h2>DOGE Coin SpaceX Mission (2022)</h2>
      <p>After Elon Musk's coveted Episode of SNL, SpaceX which was founded by none other than Mr. Musk 
          himself booked a mission to the moon that would be fully funded by the DOGE Coin currency.
          During his time on SNL, Elon joked about about having a role to spread memes pertaining to
          cryptocurrency. Geometric Energy Corp has planned a rideshare mission to the moon aboard 
          the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which costs around $62 million to book, or in this instance 
          129 million DOGE coin. After guest hosting SNL, he later tweeted saying 
          "This would be the first time cryptocurrency will be used in space and that it will be 
          the first meme in space.. TO THE MOOOOON!!"</p>
